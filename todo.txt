o (DrugName, { (GeneName, PhenotypeName) }) -> Recommendation ; what's the limit on set size?
  - if it varies:
    - try cubric:
      - efficient subset join condition?
        - create 2 simple tables of subsets of number 1...n, and see how fast 
          it joins
  - if it's within a handful:
    - stick with mysql and create a mapping from gene-names to subsets containing those genes
      - perform a subset join in-memory
o (GeneName, HaplotypeName, HaplotypeName) -> PhenotypeName ; any reliable source of this information?

Questions:
- Aaron
  - Is there any consistency in how PharmGKB maps genotypes (in particular a gene name [e.g. CYP2D6] and 2 haplotypes [e.g.  
    *1/*2] that span that gene) to phenotypes (e.g. Ultrarapid metabolizer). For CYP2D6 
    (http://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA128#tabview=tab0&subtab=31), it looks like they give a table from literature, where they 
    identify genotypes as english descriptions such as "An individual carrying more than two copies of functional alleles".  
    I then note from the excel file that you have the haplotypes colour-coded based on whether they're "functioning allele", 
    "non-functional", or "hyperactive".  

    So, ideally it would be good if I had a dataset that was like:
    GENE_NAME HAPLOTYPE1 HAPLOTYPE2 PHENOTYPE
    CYP2D6
    
    The problem now is knowing what haplotypes
